Description:
The name of my project is GraphIt and it is a graphing calculator. It has 2 modes
a 2D graphing mode and a 3D graphing mode. It can graph any function of your choice
and its derivative(s). 

How to Run:
On the 2D graphing, you can plot any function by using either the keyboard provided 
in the app or your normal laptop keyboad. 
You need to use brackets around the x in funtions such as sin(x) and sqrt(x). Once
you have typed in a function, click 'Go', and the app will plot the function. You can
zoom in and out by using the + and - buttons in the bottom right corner. If you want
the derivative of the function, press the (d/dx) button in the bottom right corner and 
the plot (and the derivative expression) will apprear. To get rid of derivative either 
press the d/dx button again or just open the keyboard. You can switch over to the 3D plot
by pressing the 3D Mode button in the top left corner. 
The 3D mode works in the same way. Select a function you would like to graph and click
'go' and the plot will appear. Press the d/dx button for the x  partial derivative of the 
function and d/dy for the y partial derivative. You can rotate the plot by dragging your mouse. 
If you want to see the the bivariate normal of the plane, press the "normal" button in the keyboard. 
You can switch back to 2D mode by pressing the 2D mode button in the top left corner.
